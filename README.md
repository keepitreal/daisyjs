daisyjs
=======

A JavaScript implementation of the DaisyDiff library

# Description

DaisyDiff was originally a Java library developed to diff/version control HTML content. It was a Google Summer of Code project in 2007
and was later implemented in PHP in 2008.

See [here](https://code.google.com/p/daisydiff/) for more details on the original project.

# This Implementation

I started this implementation because I'd like to use this library on the client side. I hope to release this on NPM at some point but it all depends on how much I'm able to work on this.

# Warning

This project is still in its infancy so at this point the library is far from useable!
